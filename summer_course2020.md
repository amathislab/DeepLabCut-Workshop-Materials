This document is an outline of resources for an informal coursefor those wanting to learn to use DeepLabCut (while responsibly isolating due to COVID-19). We expect it to take *roughly* 1-2 weeks to get through.


:purple_heart: We would also be very excited if you contributed to the newly launched DeepLabCut Model Zoo while you learn! Namely, you can learn to use DeepLabCut on data that can be used to build better community tools!! Please contact us in this form if you are interested: https://forms.gle/KRtdKKYB57ZkaBwH7 :purple_heart:

## Quick Start:

You need: Anaconda for python3 and DeepLabCut installed (CPU version)
- you should have a [CPU version of DeepLabCut installed on your laptop](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/conda-environments/README.md). We will assume you don't all have GPUs at home, so we will 
utilize cloud-computing resources for those steps. 

- **WATCH:** overview of conda:  [Python Tutorial: Anaconda - Installation and Using Conda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk)

 - **ACTION:** [Install DeepLabCut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut/blob/master/docs/installation.md)

**What you need:** any videos where you can see the animals/objects, etc. 
You can use our demo videos, grab some from the internet, or use whatever older data you have. Any camera, color/monchrome, etc will work. Find diverse videos, and label what you want to track well :) 
- IF YOU ARE PART OF THE COURSE: you will be contributing to the DLC Model Zoo :smile:

:purple_heart: **NOTE:** if you want to contribute back to community-science, please get in touch with us as we have a LOT of data we want to label to be able to share back with everyone; So, if you want to help sign up here (labeling can be on data we provide or possibly yours): https://forms.gle/KRtdKKYB57ZkaBwH7 :purple_heart:

### **Module 4: Scaling your analysis to many new videos**

Once you have good networks, you can deploy them. You can create "cron jobs" to run a timed analysis script, for example. We run this daily on new videos collected in the lab. Check out a simple script to get started, and read more below:
 
   - [Analyzing videos in batches, over many folders, setting up automated data processing](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DLCutils/tree/master/SCALE_YOUR_ANALYSIS)

### **Module 5: Got Poses? Now what ...**

Pose estimation took away the painful part of digitizing your data, but now what? There is a rich set of tools out there to help you create your own custom analysis, or use others (and edit them to your needs). Check out more below:
